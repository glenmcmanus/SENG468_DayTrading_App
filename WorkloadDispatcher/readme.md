#WorkloadDispatcher

Depending on your system you may need to call this with python or python3.

For me, it's python3, so that's what I've written below.

###Installation

You may need to install the "requests" package, you can do that with pip:

python3 -m pip install requests

###CLI usage:

python3 WorkloadDispatcher.py <workload_file>
